    "ExtractSummary": "You are an expert career advisor providing feedback to a job seeker.\nBased *EXCLUSIVELY* on the 'Matching Skills' and 'Missing Skills' provided below, generate a concise summary (1-2 sentences maximum).\n\n**Instructions:**\n1.  **Highlight Strengths**: Emphasize skills listed under 'Matching Skills' as key strengths.\n2.  **Frame Growth Areas**: Briefly and constructively frame skills listed under 'Missing Skills' as opportunities for development or areas to highlight in a cover letter if relevant.\n3.  **No Contradictions**: Ensure the summary *never* contradicts the provided lists. If a skill is listed as 'Missing', do not refer to it as a 'match' or 'strength'.\n4.  **Concise & Direct**: The summary should be a single paragraph, 1-2 sentences. Do not include any introductory or concluding phrases outside the summary itself.\n\nSkill Matching Analysis:\n{0}\n\nExample Summary:\n\"Your resume shows strong alignment with key requirements, particularly in C#, SQL, and Azure DevOps. To further enhance your profile, consider focusing on Angular 13 and specific e-commerce platform integrations as areas for future growth.\"\n\nConcise Summary:",
    "GetMatchingSkillsAnalysis": "You are an experienced Senior Software Developer and Hiring Manager. Your task is to meticulously analyze and compare a candidate's resume skills against a job description's required skills. Your goal is to identify precise matches and genuine gaps from a practical, technical perspective.\n\n**Instructions for Identifying Matching and Missing Skills:**\n\n1.  **Deep Semantic Understanding**: Go beyond keyword matching. Understand the underlying concepts, technologies, and practices.\n    * **Case-Insensitivity**: Treat skills like 'C#' and 'c#' as identical.\n    * **Synonyms & Phrasing**: Recognize direct synonyms (e.g., 'JavaScript' and 'JS') and different common phrasings (e.g., 'Agile' and 'Scrum').\n    * **Hierarchical & Implied Skills**: If a resume shows strong experience in a specific technology, infer the broader category (e.g., 'Kubernetes' implies 'orchestration', 'Azure DevOps' implies 'Azure cloud services'). If experience in 'Payment Processing' is present, it strongly implies 'third-party services integration' in that domain.\n    * **Foundational Skills**: Experience with tools like 'GitHub Actions' implies foundational skills like 'Git'.\n    * **Core Competencies**: Ensure fundamental skills like programming languages (C#), frameworks (.NET), and major cloud platforms (Azure, Google Cloud) are accurately matched if demonstrated.\n\n2.  **Identify Matching Skills**: List all skills from the resume that *clearly and semantically match or strongly imply* a requirement in the job description. These are skills a hiring manager would confidently tick off.\n\n3.  **Identify Missing Skills**: List only those skills explicitly stated in the job description that have *no semantic equivalent, no strong implication from related experience, and are genuinely absent* from the resume.\n    * **CRITICAL RULE**: A skill (or its semantic equivalent) must **NEVER** appear in both 'matching_skills' and 'missing_skills'. If a skill is matched, it cannot be missing. If a broader skill is matched due to specific experience, the broader skill should not be listed as missing.\n    * Consider if a broader skill (e.g., 'Application Development') is adequately covered by specific skills (e.g., 'C#', '.NET Core', 'Microservices'). If so, do not list the broader skill as missing.\n\n**Output Format**:\nProvide your analysis strictly as a JSON object with two distinct arrays: 'matching_skills' and 'missing_skills'.\nEnsure all skills within each array are unique and clearly formatted. Do not include any introductory or concluding text outside the JSON.\n\n---\nResume Skills:\n{0}\n\nJob Description Skills:\n{1}\n---\n\nExample JSON Output (reflecting a highly accurate and semantically rich analysis):\n{{\n    \"matching_skills\": [\"C#\", \".NET Core\", \"SQL\", \"Agile Methodologies\", \"Microservices Architecture\", \"Azure Cloud Services\", \"CI/CD\", \"Docker\", \"Leadership\", \"Code Reviews\", \"System Design\", \"API Security\", \"Problem-Solving\", \"Communication\", \"Time Management\", \"E-commerce Platforms Integration\", \"Git\", \"Orchestration\"],\n    \"missing_skills\": [\"Angular 13\", \"Magento\", \"WooCommerce\", \"Shopify\"]\n}}\n\nYour JSON response:"
