    "GetMatchingSkillsAnalysis": "You are a principal Technical Recruiter and Senior Software Engineer. Your task is to meticulously analyze a candidate's resume against a job description. Your ultimate goal is to produce two *mutually exclusive* lists of skills: 'matching_skills' and 'missing_skills', ensuring no skill or its direct synonym/variant appears in both lists.\n\n**Input:**\n- Resume Skills: {0}\n- Job Description Skills: {1}\n\n**CORE OVERRIDING RULES (PRIORITIZE THESE ABOVE ALL ELSE):**\n\n1.  **NO CONTRADICTIONS - ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: A skill (or its direct semantic equivalent/covering skill) **MUST NOT AND CANNOT** appear in both 'matching_skills' and 'missing_skills'. If a skill is deemed matching, it is not missing. If it is missing, it is not matching. This is the **most critical rule** and any violation is a fatal error.\n2.  **STRICT PRESENCE FOR MATCHING**: For a skill to be in 'matching_skills', it MUST be explicitly mentioned in the resume or undeniably implied by strong, direct evidence of related technologies/experience in the resume. Do NOT infer a match if the resume does not strongly support it.\n3.  **STRICT ABSENCE FOR MISSING**: For a skill to be in 'missing_skills', it MUST be explicitly required by the job description AND genuinely absent from the resume, meaning no direct semantic equivalent or strongly implied related experience (as per Rule 2) in the resume fulfills that specific job description requirement.\n\n**Detailed Instructions for Skill Identification:**\n\n* **Accuracy First**: Base your analysis *strictly* on the provided resume and job description text. Do not invent skills or infer experience that isn't clearly supported by the resume text.\n* **Semantic Understanding & Synonyms:**\n    * Case-Insensitive: Treat 'C#' and 'c#' as identical.\n    * Direct Synonyms & Phrasing: Recognize common direct synonyms (e.g., 'JavaScript'/'JS', 'Agile'/'Scrum'). Also, consider common variations like 'Azure' vs. 'Microsoft Azure' as the same skill for matching/missing purposes.\n* **Foundational & Hierarchical Skills (Use Conservatively but Accurately):**\n    * If a resume lists 'GitHub Actions', it implies 'Git'. If 'ASP.NET Core' is listed, it implies '.NET'. Match these foundational elements if they satisfy a JD requirement.\n    * A broader skill from the JD can be considered 'matching' if the resume demonstrates *significant, explicit experience* with multiple specific technologies/tasks that collectively and undeniably fulfill that broader requirement (e.g., extensive 'Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines', 'Azure App Services', 'Azure Functions' experience can collectively match a JD requirement for 'Azure Cloud Services').\n    * A specific technology in the resume (e.g., 'Kubernetes') can match a more general JD requirement (e.g., 'Container Orchestration').\n    * For cloud platforms and DevOps tools, strong evidence of specific services or processes (e.g., 'Azure DevOps pipelines', 'Azure SQL', 'Google Cloud Build') should be sufficient to match broader requirements (e.g., 'Microsoft Azure', 'CI/CD'). Direct matches of named tools (e.g., 'Azure DevOps') should always be prioritized as 'matching'.\n* **Handling Specific Version Requirements**: If a specific version of a technology is required (e.g., 'Angular 16 or higher'), and the resume does not explicitly mention that technology *at all*, it MUST be considered a 'missing_skill'. Do not infer the presence of a technology (like 'Angular') if it is not explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by directly related, equivalent experience in the resume.\n* **Generic vs. Specific Skills**: Prioritize specific technical skills over very generic ones (e.g., 'Software Development') when placing them in 'matching_skills' or 'missing_skills'. If 'Software Development' is a JD requirement and specific development skills (C#, .NET) are present, it should be considered 'matching'. However, if it's missing specific evidence, it can be 'missing'. Ensure consistency.\n\n**Output Format**:\nProvide your analysis *strictly* as a JSON object with two distinct arrays: 'matching_skills' and 'missing_skills'.\nAll skills within each array must be unique and clearly formatted strings. The order of skills within the arrays does not matter.\nDo not include any introductory or concluding text, explanations, or apologies outside the JSON structure.\n\n---\nResume Skills:\n{0}\n\nJob Description Skills:\n{1}\n---\n\nExample JSON Output (reflecting accurate, conservative, and non-contradictory analysis where skills are *mutually exclusive*):\n{{\n    \"matching_skills\": [\"C#\", \".NET Core\", \"SQL Server\", \"Agile Methodologies\", \"Microservices Architecture\", \"Azure DevOps\", \"CI/CD\", \"Git\", \"Problem-Solving\", \"Communication\"],\n    \"missing_skills\": [\"Angular 13\", \"Kubernetes (if not implied by other tools)\", \"NoSQL Databases (e.g., Cosmos DB)\", \"Advanced TypeScript\"]\n}}\n\nYour JSON response:",

    "ExtractJDExperience": "<context>\nYOU ARE A PRINCIPAL TECHNICAL RECRUITER AND AN EXPERT AT PRECISELY EXTRACTING NUMERICAL EXPERIENCE DATA.\n</context>\n\n<task>\nYour task is to accurately determine the overall years of professional experience from the provided job description text.\n\n**Instructions (ADHERE STRICTLY AND SEQUENTIALLY):**\n\n1.  **PRIMARY EXTRACTION: EXPLICIT OVERALL EXPERIENCE (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**\n    * First and foremost, meticulously search for an **explicitly stated single number** representing overall years of professional experience within the Job Description Text. Look for patterns such as:\n        * 'X+ years of experience'\n        * 'X years experience'\n        * 'at least X years'\n        * 'X-Y years'\n        * 'X.5 years'\n        * 'over X years'\n        * 'X years in [role/field]'\n        * And any other clear numerical statement of total experience.\n    * **CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULE:** When you identify such a pattern, **extract ONLY the numerical part as a pure, whole digit integer**. \n        * For '10+ years', output `10`.\n        * For '3.5 years', output `3` (always truncate/round down to the nearest whole number integer; DO NOT round up).\n        * For '1-2 years', output `1` (always the lower bound).\n        * For '5 years in Software Development', output `5`.\n    * **IF AN EXPLICIT NUMBER IS FOUND, STOP PROCESSING AND USE THAT NUMBER.** Do NOT perform date-based calculation.\n\n2.  **SECONDARY CALCULATION: INFERENCE FROM DATES (IF PRIMARY EXTRACTION FAILS):**\n    * **ONLY if no explicit overall years of experience are found** from Instruction 1, then proceed to calculate the overall experience by analyzing the **start and end dates** of individual experience entries within the Job Description Text.\n    * **Calculation Method:** For each distinct experience entry, determine its duration in months. Sum the durations of all distinct, non-overlapping experience entries. Treat 'Present' or similar current indicators as the current date for calculation.\n    * **Convert to Years (CRITICAL):** Convert the total sum of months into a whole number of years. Always **round down/truncate** any fractional years (e.g., 30 months = 2 years, 18 months = 1 year). Do NOT round up.\n    * **Overlap Handling (CRITICAL):** If there are overlapping experience periods (e.g., two jobs at the same time), **count the overlapping period only once** towards the total overall experience. Calculate the unique active employment duration.\n\n3.  **DEFAULT VALUE:** If neither explicit experience nor calculable dates yield a number, output `0` (zero).\n\n</task>\n\n<input>\nJob Description Text:\n{0}\n</input>\n\n<output>\n**Strict Output Format (JSON Only):** Respond **ONLY** with a JSON object containing a single key `\"OverallExperience\"` with the extracted integer value. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or conversational filler before or after the JSON.\n\n**Expected JSON Output Format (CRITICAL: VALUE MUST BE A PLAIN JSON INTEGER, NOT AN OBJECT):**\n```json\n{{\n  \"OverallExperience\": 0\n}}\n```\n</output>\n\nYour JSON output:"
